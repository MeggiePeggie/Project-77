        <p>Visual Studio is a coding platform which is colourful and easy to use. It's kinda like Brackets, but only better! The codes are written in colour  
         and has a great name. At the top you have File, Edit, Selection, View, Go, Run, Terminal and Help. </p>

         <p> The console screen is a screen you can only see if you know where to look. I think it displays all the variables and things that don't need to be seem by others.  </p>
